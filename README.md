glx demo
---
this demo shows how to use OpenGL with gtk. especially how to render 
a GdkWindow as a texture. this is very primitive. you need to run it under
a compositing environment. this use plain old fixed pipeline OpenGL API
for simplicity. I'll add OpenGL shader example later with multiple texture 
blending support.
